This repository holds modifications that will enable WebGL
functionality in the Android browser. It is based on ics-mr1,
and requires that webkit is built with USE_ACCELERATED_COMPOSITING
and that the browser application is built with hardwareAccelerated=true.

To try this out, apply the patch to external/webkit in ics-mr1,
and build with "make libwebcore".

This is still work in progress but we wanted to make it available
as soon as possible. Feedback is welcome!
